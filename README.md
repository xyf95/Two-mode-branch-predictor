Branch prediction is a long-lasting topic to overcome the performance limitation of modern high-performance architecture. This report will focus on correlated branches prediction, propose a new two-mode (hybrid) branch predictor according to 2-level global branch predictor, compare it to the existed correlated predictor by using the simulator-SimpleScalar.

Install the SimpleScalar simulator and replace the file into modefied files. Than run the simplescalar again
